# OpenClaw Upgrade Guide

Safe upgrade procedure for production SDR agents. Follow every step — skipping the backup or verification has caused real outages.

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

```bash
# 1. Backup config (ALWAYS do this first)
cp -r ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak
cp -r ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json.bak

# 2. Check changelog for breaking changes
openclaw changelog          # or visit https://openclaw.dev/changelog
# Look for: config key renames, removed fields, new required fields,
# permission model changes, plugin API changes

# 3. Note current version
openclaw --version
```

## Upgrade

```bash
# 4. Install new version
npm install -g openclaw@latest

# 5. Refresh gateway service token (required since 2026.4.1)
#    New versions may change internal auth — stale tokens cause
#    exec approval timeouts and tool call failures.
openclaw gateway install --force

# 6. Run doctor (auto-detects and suggests fixes)
openclaw doctor

# 7. Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Post-Upgrade Verification

```bash
# 8. Verify gateway is live
curl -s http://localhost:18789/health
# Expected: {"ok":true,"status":"live"}

# 9. Verify channels
openclaw channels status
# Both Telegram and WhatsApp should show "running"

# 10. Verify exec approvals
openclaw approvals get
# Should show: security=full, ask=off, askFallback=full

# 11. Check for skill warnings
openclaw doctor 2>&1 | grep -i "skip\|error\|warn"
# If you see "Skipping skill path that resolves outside its configured root":
#   find ~/.openclaw/skills -maxdepth 1 -type l | while read l; do
#     target=$(readlink "$l")
#     realpath "$l" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^$HOME/.openclaw/skills" || echo "external: $l -> $target"
#   done
#   # Remove external symlinks that are no longer valid
```

## Rollback

If anything breaks:

```bash
# Restore config
cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
cp ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json.bak ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json

# Downgrade
npm install -g openclaw@<previous-version>

# Restart
openclaw gateway install --force
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Known Issues by Version

### 2026.4.20

**Security-critical upgrade.** Multiple env injection vectors closed, config mutation guard extended, WebSocket scoping hardened.

| Change / Feature | Notes | Action Required |
|------------------|-------|-----------------|
| `OPENCLAW_*` keys blocked from workspace `.env` | All `OPENCLAW_*` env keys + `MINIMAX_API_HOST` + interpreter-startup keys (e.g. `NODE_OPTIONS`) are blocked in untrusted `.env` files | Move any such keys to system environment or `openclaw.json` before upgrading |
| Config mutation guard extended | `config.patch` / `config.apply` tool calls from model agents can no longer overwrite operator-trusted config paths | No action needed — security improvement |
| Non-admin paired devices scoped | Non-admin paired-device sessions can only manage their own pairing; cannot approve/reject other devices | No action needed unless automation scripts relied on cross-device approval |
| WebSocket `operator.read` required | Chat/agent/tool-result WebSocket frames require `operator.read` scope | If custom WebSocket clients don't carry `operator.read`, add the scope to their auth token |
| Session entry cap + age prune enforced by default | Oversized session stores are pruned at load time | Tune `session.maxEntries` / `session.maxAgeMs` in `openclaw.json` if you need larger stores |
| Cron state split to `jobs-state.json` | Runtime execution state separated from `jobs.json` definitions | If version-controlling `jobs.json`, add `jobs-state.json` to `.gitignore` if not already present |
| Telegram polling watchdog 90s → 120s | `channels.telegram.pollingStallThresholdMs` raised | No action needed; set explicitly if you want a different threshold |
| Web search plugin `SecretRef` resolution fixed | Exa, Firecrawl, Perplexity, Tavily, Grok, Gemini, Kimi plugin API keys now resolve correctly | No action needed — bug fix |
| Auto-failover session overrides cleared per-turn | Transient failover state cleared before each new turn | No action needed — ensures primary model is used by default |

### 2026.4.10

**No breaking changes.** Upgrade is safe — new features opt-in, 126 security fixes applied automatically.

| Change / Feature | Notes | Action Required |
|------------------|-------|-----------------|
| Active Memory plugin | New opt-in plugin — disabled by default | Enable in `openclaw.json` under `plugins.active-memory.enabled: true` if desired |
| Codex provider for GPT-5 | `codex/gpt-*` routes use new bundled Codex provider; `openai/gpt-*` unchanged | If using GPT-5 via `openai` provider, migrate model IDs to `codex/gpt-5` for managed auth |
| `openclaw exec-policy` CLI | New command for managing exec approval policy | No action required — use `openclaw exec-policy show` to inspect current policy |
| Teams message actions | Pin, unpin, read, react, listReactions now available | No config change needed; actions are auto-discoverable via the gateway |
| Per-provider `allowPrivateNetwork` | Self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoints can opt in to private network access | Only set if you run internal/LAN-hosted model endpoints |
| 126 security + stability fixes | WhatsApp media, gateway stability, iMessage self-chat, Telegram validation, cron scheduling, etc. | No action required — applied on upgrade |

### 2026.4.9

**Breaking change: workspace `.env` runtime-control env vars blocked.**

| Issue / Change | Symptom | Fix |
|----------------|---------|-----|
| Workspace `.env` runtime-control vars silently ignored | Config overrides via `.env` (e.g. `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, `OPENCLAW_SKIP_*`, `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_*`) have no effect after upgrade | Move these vars to system environment (set before daemon start) or to `openclaw.json` under the matching config keys |
| SSRF quarantine bypass fixed | Agents or malicious pages could bypass blocked-destination checks via simulated click navigation | No action needed — fixed automatically |
| OpenAI reasoning effort defaults to `high` | OpenAI users on Responses/WebSocket/completions may see higher token usage | Set `reasoningEffort: "medium"` or `"low"` explicitly if cost is a concern |
| Ollama thinking output | Ollama models now emit thinking when `/think` is active | Opt out by keeping `/think` at off level |
| Matrix `dm.policy: "trusted"` migrated | `openclaw doctor --fix` will convert legacy Matrix DM policy to `allowlist` form | Run `openclaw doctor` after upgrade to review proposed changes before applying |

### 2026.4.8

**No breaking changes.** Upgrade is safe — fixes only.

| Issue Fixed | Symptom (v2026.4.7) | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Cross-origin redirect secret leak | Auth tokens could leak on 307/308 redirects via SSRF-guarded fetches | Fixed automatically — no config change needed |
| Telegram setup failure | `Cannot find module './dist/...'` on packaged installs / npm global install | Module now loads from bundled sidecars |
| Slack proxy ignored | Socket Mode WebSocket bypasses corporate HTTP proxy | Now respects `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` env vars |
| Slack bot token re-read | `SecretRef`-backed bot tokens fail after `openclaw gateway restart` | Resolved in SecretRef resolution path |
| Claude thinking blocks stripped | Opus 4.5+/Sonnet 4.5+/Claude 4 thinking blocks dropped before forwarding → reasoning regressions | Fixed — thinking blocks preserved |
| Web fetch HTTP/2 failure | `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` or connection errors on Node 22+ | `allowH2: false` applied; upgrade to v2026.4.8 |
| Memory vector recall silent | No warning when sqlite-vec unavailable | Now logs explicit warning |
| Cron job "unknown id" | Cron jobs show "unknown cron job id" after gateway restart | `jobId` now loaded from on-disk store |

### 2026.4.7

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `/allowlist` requires owner | `error: permission denied — owner required` when non-owner runs `/allowlist add` | Ensure only owner accounts manage allowlists; update automation that used non-owner accounts for this |
| Env override blocks | Workflows injecting Java/Rust/Git/Kubernetes/cloud credential env vars via model layer silently blocked | Move env var injection to `deploy.sh` or workspace config — out of model instruction path |
| `gateway config.apply` blocked from model | Runtime config patches via AI tool calls fail with `blocked: model-facing write` | Use direct gateway API calls with human approval for config changes |
| Docker bind change | Gateway now auto-binds to `0.0.0.0` inside containers | If you relied on loopback-only binding in Docker, set `bind: loopback` explicitly |

### 2026.4.5

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Legacy config aliases removed | Startup warning: `unknown config key: talk.voiceId` (or `talk.apiKey`, `agents.*.sandbox.perSession`, `browser.ssrfPolicy.allowPrivateNetwork`, `hooks.internal.handlers`) | Run `openclaw doctor --fix` to auto-migrate to canonical paths |
| Channel `allow` toggle removed | Warning about unrecognized `allow` field on channel/group/room config | Replace with `dmPolicy` + `allowFrom` — run `openclaw doctor --fix` |

### 2026.4.1

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Gateway embedded token stale | `exec approval followup dispatch failed: gateway timeout after 60000ms` | `openclaw gateway install --force` |
| Exec approvals empty defaults | Tools silently fail, agent can't execute commands | Set `exec-approvals.json` defaults to `security: full, ask: off` |
| Telegram dmPolicy default | `dmPolicy: "pairing"` blocks new contacts | Change to `"open"` + add `allowFrom: ["*"]` |
| Skill symlink security check | `Skipping skill path that resolves outside its configured root` (hundreds of warnings) | Remove external symlinks from `~/.openclaw/skills/` |
| Missing tools.profile | Tool calls may be restricted | Add `"tools": {"profile": "full"}` to `openclaw.json` |

## Re-Deploy (Nuclear Option)

If manual fixes aren't enough, re-deploy from template:

```bash
cd b2b-sdr-agent-template/deploy
./deploy.sh <client-name>
# This applies all fixes automatically (v3.3.1+)
```
