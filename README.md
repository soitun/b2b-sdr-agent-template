## What It Does

### Full-Pipeline Sales Automation

| Stage | What the AI Does |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Lead Capture** | Auto-detect inbound messages, create CRM records, extract key info |
| **BANT Qualification** | Natural conversation to assess Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline |
| **Research** | Search prospect's company, LinkedIn, news — update ICP score |
| **Quotation** | Generate quotes, send to owner for approval, deliver to customer |
| **Negotiation** | Track counter-offers, recommend strategy, escalate when needed |
| **Reporting** | Daily pipeline reports, stalled lead alerts, weekly summaries |
| **Nurture** | Automated follow-ups, industry news, post-sale care |

### Human-Like Conversations
- Responds in the customer's language (auto-detected)
- Natural message pacing with delivery-queue skill
- Cultural adaptation (Middle East, Africa, SEA, LatAm, Europe)
- Never reveals AI identity — presents as your sales consultant

### Smart Memory
- **Hot memory**: Company context loaded every session
- **Warm memory**: Daily conversation logs, loaded on demand
- **Cold memory**: Archived insights, searchable via vector DB

## The 7 Layers Explained

| Layer | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Identity** | `IDENTITY.md` | Company info, role definition, pipeline stages, lead tiering |
| **Soul** | `SOUL.md` | AI personality, communication style, hard rules, growth mindset |
| **Agents** | `AGENTS.md` | 8-stage sales workflow, BANT qualification, security policy |
| **User** | `USER.md` | Owner profile, product lines, ICP scoring, competitors |
| **Heartbeat** | `HEARTBEAT.md` | Automated pipeline inspection — new leads, stalled deals, data quality |
| **Memory** | `MEMORY.md` | 3-tier memory architecture, SDR effectiveness principles |
| **Tools** | `TOOLS.md` | CRM commands, channel config, web research, email access |

## Skills

Pre-built capabilities that extend your AI SDR:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **delivery-queue** | Schedule messages with human-like delays. Drip campaigns, timed follow-ups. |
| **supermemory** | Semantic memory engine. Auto-capture customer insights, search across all conversations. |
| **sdr-humanizer** | Rules for natural conversation — pacing, cultural adaptation, anti-patterns. |

### Skill Profiles

cp examples/heavy-vehicles/USER.md workspace/USER.md
# Then customize for your specific business
```

## Product Knowledge Base

Structure your product catalog so the AI can generate accurate quotes:

```
product-kb/
├── catalog.json                    # Product catalog with specs, MOQ, lead times
├── products/
│   └── example-product/info.json   # Detailed product info
└── scripts/
    └── generate-pi.js              # Proforma invoice generator
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- A Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Node.js 18+
- An AI model API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Kimi, etc.)
- WhatsApp Business account (optional but recommended)
